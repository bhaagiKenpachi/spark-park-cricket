## Quick Start

### For Fresh Database Setup:
```bash
# 1. Reset and migrate database
go run scripts/reset_and_migrate.go

# 2. Follow the instructions to execute SQL in Supabase dashboard

# 3. Start the server
go run cmd/server/main.go

# 4. Test the APIs
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/series
curl http://localhost:8080/api/v1/matches
```

### For Testing:
```bash
# Test scoring functionality
go run scripts/test_scoring.go

# Test WebSocket functionality  
go run scripts/test_websocket.go
```

## Environment Requirements

All scripts require the following environment variables in `.env`:
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL
- `SUPABASE_API_KEY`: Your Supabase API key

## Notes

- The main reset script (`reset_and_migrate.go`) handles both data deletion and provides migration instructions
- Manual SQL execution is required due to Supabase API limitations for DDL operations
- All scripts include comprehensive error handling and status reporting
- The simplified system uses Team A vs Team B instead of complex team management

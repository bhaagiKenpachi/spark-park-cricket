2025-09-18T06:34:40.0041461Z npm warn deprecated @types/redux-saga@0.10.5: This is a stub types definition for redux-saga (https://github.com/redux-saga/redux-saga). redux-saga provides its own type definitions, so you don't need @types/redux-saga installed!
2025-09-18T06:34:40.2180392Z npm warn deprecated inflight@1.0.6: This module is not supported, and leaks memory. Do not use it. Check out lru-cache if you want a good and tested way to coalesce async requests by a key value, which is much more comprehensive and powerful.

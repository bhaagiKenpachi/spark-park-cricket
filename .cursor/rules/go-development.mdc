# Go Development Rules

Always use proper Go formatting with `gofmt` and follow Go naming conventions. Use meaningful variable names, proper error handling with explicit error returns, and leverage Go's built-in testing framework for unit tests. Prefer composition over inheritance and use interfaces for abstraction.

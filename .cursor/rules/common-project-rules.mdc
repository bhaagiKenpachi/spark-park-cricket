# Common Project Rules

**No shell scripting allowed** - Do not create any shell scripts (.sh, .bash, .zsh files) or include shell commands in any part of the project. **No debugging scripts allowed** - Do not create any debugging scripts, console.log statements for debugging, or temporary debugging code in any language. All code should be production-ready and properly tested without relying on debugging utilities.
